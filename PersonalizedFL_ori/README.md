# PersonalizedFL: Personalized Federated Learning Codebase

An easy-to-learn, easy-to-extend, and for-fair-comparison codebase based on PyTorch for federated learning (FL). 
Please note that this repository is designed mainly for research, and we discard lots of unnecessary extensions for a quick start.
Example usage: when you want to recognize activities of different persons without accessing their privacy data; when you want to build a model based on multiple patients' data but not access their own data.

## Implemented Algorithms

As initial version, we support the following algoirthms. We are working on more algorithms. 

1. Baseline, train in the client without communication.
2. FedAvg [1].
3. FedProx [2].
4. FedBN [3].
5. FedAP [4].
6. MetaFed [5].
7. FedCLIP [6].

**NOTE:** The code for FedCLIP is located at [`./fedclip`](./fedclip/). This folder is independent of other folders in this repo. You can just download the folder and run it for this algorithm.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PersonalizedFL.git
cd PersonalizedFL
```
We recommend to use `Python 3.7.1` and `torch 1.7.1` which are in our development environment. 
For more environmental details and a full re-production of our results, please refer to `luwang0517/torch10:latest` (docker) or `jindongwang/docker` (docker).

## Dataset

Our code supports the following dataset:

* [VLCS](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/VLCS/VLCS.zip)
* [PACS](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/PACS.zip)
* [Office-Home](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/OfficeHome.zip)
* [PAMAP2](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/cycfed/pamap.tar.gz)
* [COVID](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/cycfed/covid19.tar.gz)
* [OrganS-MNIST](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/cycfed/medmnist.tar.gz)
* [OrganA-MNIST](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/cycfed/medmnistA.tar.gz)
* [OrganC-MNIST](https://wjdcloud.blob.core.windows.net/dataset/cycfed/medmnistC.tar.gz)

If you want to use your own dataset, please modifty `datautil/prepare_data.py` to contain the dataset.

## Usage

1. Modify the file in the scripts
2. `bash run.sh`

## Benchmark

We offer a benchmark for OrganS-MNIST. Please note that the results are based on the data splits in `split/medmnist0.1`. Different data splits may lead different results. For complete parameters, please refer to `run.sh`.

| Non-iid alpha | Base | FedAvg | FedProx | FedBN | FedAP | MetaFed |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 0.1 | 73.99 | 75.62 | 75.97 | 79.96 | 81.33 | 83.87 |
| 0.01 | 75.83 | 74.81 | 75.09 | 81.85 | 82.87 | 84.98 |

## Customization

It is easy to design your own method following the steps:

1. Add your method to `alg/`, and add the reference to it in `alg/algs.py`.

2. Midify `scripts/run.sh` and execuate it.
